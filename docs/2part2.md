If you had to store all your savings in cash and put it under the mattress for 20 years, which currency would you choose? Out of the hundres of currencies available, the most viable options are: U.S. dollars, euros, british punds, schweizer franc, japense yen, and maybe - depending on where you live - your own home currency. The limited number of reasonable answers out of the many possible choices reveal an important fact about money: some currencies are better than others.

<!-- The ways in which they are better can differ,
accepted + SoV due to stable economy / central bank.
-->

((for those people ((x billion)) who are not fortunate enough to live in a country who uses one of the five viable currencies, adopting cryptocurrencies instead of their shitty local currency is a both smart and not unlikely.))

# Internet of money

* Bitcoin is fast cheap global mobile payment.
* Cryptocurrencies will do to value what the internet did to information. (infoga från talk 1 ur boken internet of money vol 2)
* Email was the first real application of the internet. Payments is the first real application of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.
* Another similarity between bitcoin and email is that if you know someones email or bitcoin adress then you can send them information or value instantly across the globe, but it can only be sent if your password or private key.
* The internet have disrupted many industries (e.g. media). Cryptocurrencies will disrupt many industries (e.g. finance).
* Different cryptocurrencies have different use cases. There will be multiple winners. But who?

Other similarities to internet are:

* before the internet, sending information was done differently based on whether it was a photo, document, ... before cryptocurrencies, sending value was done differently based on your location, the amount you sent (banking networks for fast transfers or large tranfers exists but not for both). internet and bitconi are networks that can handle eveything.
* few people understand the technology
* you don't need to understand how it works in order to use it.
* hard to use (more on this later) but it becomes easier every day
* mostly geeks use it
* mostly geeks know about the potential future use cases
* many different projects exists, each with different goals
* a lot of vc money (include data point)


# brief history of money

[comment]: "the main goal there is to establish there is nothing magical about fiat. we have had other forms of money. start with a history of money and then describe its properties."

## my ideas - vad detta avsnitt ska förmedla

the history of money provides important lessons:

* money is needed for trade. it was invented everywhere around the globe.
* we have used many forms of money: seashells in some places (not beaches) coins in others.
* some things are more moeny than others. for something to be used as money it should satisfy a few proprties: x y z. coins are more popular than other things because it fulfils proprties nicely.
* we moved from coins to paper money because it was more convinient.
* when moving to paper money, mistakes were made over and over again (e.g. print a lot => get inflation)
* fiat money is not backed by anything. it has no intrisic value. we simply agree to use it (to price goods in it and accept it to settle financial oblications). the fact we all agree on it is what makes it work. self fulfilling.
* there are good reasons to believe some people will stop using their fiat money and move (in part or in whole) to use cryptocurrencies, because (a) we have changed it before (b) it is more convinient (digital, borderless, instant, etc.) (c) it is a better form of money in the sense that it ticks more boxes (see "proprties" and the fact many fiat currencies are shitty due to inflation arising from printing money ((and high gov spending)).).

## text

Money had to be invented for trade. Before money societies relied on gifts and barter, both of which severly limits trade. Gifts limits a transaction's value and whom we can trade with, since knowing the person or having a history of successful gift exchanges would be required for valuable trades to take place. ((Another drawback with gifts are that they rely on humans remembering the quality and amount of the good which was recieved, and this is a common source of conflicts.)) Barter limits the liquidity and frequence of trade, because if paying in-kind is the only option then both the buyer and the seller must be willing to buy and sell each other goods simoultaneuously. This requires a coincidence of wants, which is unlikely. For example, what should the fisherman do when he has caught more than he is able to eat? Perhaps the fisherman need clothe, but if his society relies on barter then he must find a tailor today - otherwise the fish will be worthless. The tailor might not be hungry, but in this case the fisherman might be able to trade the fish for nuts, the nuts for beer, and the beer for clothes. Obviously the coincidence of wants introduces liquidity and accounting problems: will there be a path from fish to clothes via trading, and what are the appropriate exchange ratios for all goods? In an economy with 100 goods there are 4950 prices to keep track of. Moreover, barter is impossible for the musician who needs to pay rent to his house landlord.

Money solves these problems. All goods can be priced in terms of only one other good so that there are not thousands of exchange rates to keep track of (money is a unit of account). And the musician can recieve money when he plays the piano at a bar (money is a medium of exchange). He can use these money later to pay his rent (money is a store of value). Money can be defined in terms of its functions as a a medium of exchange, store of value and unit of account. Anything that fulfills these properties can be used as money.

Throughout history we have used many forms of money: seashells, knifes, cows, alcohol, and large stones formed in the shape of doughnuts. All of these fall under the category of commodity money. All commodity money is easy to understand, and most of them function reasonably well as a unit of account. Some commodities are more money than others, thanks to their proporties such as look, weight, divisibility, and scarcity. Gold and solver coins was introduced in 600 BC, and later on many societies used coins that had been issued by the king.

Paper money was used in China during the 11th century due to the physical hurdles with commodity money. Gold and silver merchants gave out reciepts which could redeemed for a certain amount of the commodity. This form of money fall under the category of representative money. The reciepts were in essence IOUs because it was the person who held the reciept who had the right to redeem it.
Paper money came to Europe during the 13th century, and by the 18th century gold coins had been replaced by paper money backed by gold. This monetary system is referred to as the gold standard. The paper notes were backed by gold in the sense that they were convertible into a certain amount of gold. In the 20th century almost all countries used the gold standard and made these notes legal tender.

After this many countries de-pegged their currencies from the U.S. dollar, and most of the world's currencies became unbacked by anything".

8. money can be defined as (source wiki): "Money is any item (or verifiable record) that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services as well as repayment of debts."          simply put: money works because we believe in it. the paper is not worth anything in and of itself, and the digits on an account has no intrisic value. it is only because we humans give value to it by agreeing to accept it as means of payment for goods and services which are in fact valuable. money works because we believe it works.
9. we invented money because it solved problems. we have used different forms of money, and switched from less convineint solutions like large stonges and cows to more convinient forms of money like coins, paper and even digits on a screen. When bitcoin is more convinient why not switch again?

# some properties of money

defn of money. taken from wikipedia on money.
> Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts, such as taxes, in a particular country or socio-economic context.[1][2][3] The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value and sometimes, a standard of deferred payment.[4][5] Any item or verifiable record that fulfills these functions can be considered as money.

> jag skriver om den som:
> Money is any item (or verifiable record) that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts ((in a particular region or context)). The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. Anything which fulfils these functions can be considered to be money.

Some things are more money than others. From the definition of money, it is obvious that some items or some verifiable records  function better than others. Seashells cannot be used as money on a beach, because it is not scarce. Cows are worse than metal coins because cows takes time to transport due its weight, difficult to divide and not fungible (two cows are different).

for something to function well as money it must satisfy a few important properties. it must be
scarce,
easy to verify and
hard to fake.

## from reddit

text below taken from reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/61s75o/rbitcoin_faq_newcomers_please_read/

Limited Supply - There will only ever be 21,000,000 bitcoins created and they are issued in a predictable fashion, you can view the inflation schedule here. Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.

Open source - Bitcoin code is fully auditable. You can read the source code yourself here.

Accountable - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are seen by everyone.

Decentralized - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how Bittorrent works.

Censorship resistant - No one can prevent you from interacting with the bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see Operation Chokepoint.

Push system - There are no chargebacks in bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoins reside has the authority to move them.

Low fee - Transactions fees can vary between a few cents and a few dollars depending on network demand and how much priority you wish to assign to the transaction. Most wallets calculate the fee automatically but you can view current fees here.

Borderless - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is globally distributed.

Trustless - Bitcoin solved the Byzantine's Generals Problem which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.

Pseudonymous - No need to expose personal information when purchasing with cash or transacting.

Secure - Encrypted cryptographically and can’t be brute forced or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.

Programmable - Individual units of bitcoin can be programmed to transfer based on certain criteria being met

Nearly instant - From a few seconds to a few minutes depending on need for confirmations. After a few confirmations transactions are irreversible.

Peer-to-peer - No intermediaries with a cut, no need for trusted third parties.

Portable - Bitcoins are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold. They can even be transported by simply remembering a string of words for wallet recovery.

Scalable - Each bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimals allowing it to grow in value while still accommodating micro-transactions.

Designed Money - Bitcoin was created to fit all the fundamental properties of money better than gold or fiat

## from bitcoin wiki

Unlike gold, bitcoins are:

    Easy to transfer
    Easy to secure
    Easy to verify
    Easy to granulate

Unlike fiat currencies, bitcoins are:

    Predictable and limited in supply
    Not controlled by a central authority (such as The United States Federal Reserve)
    Not debt-based

Unlike electronic fiat currency systems, bitcoins are:

    Potentially anonymous
    Freeze-proof
    Faster to transfer
    Cheaper to transfer

# different blockchains

[comment]: # "many think bitcoin is the only one. in order to sell our use case - indexing - we must spend time to expalin why this is not a winner take it all game. econ of scale, yes, but there are room for many blockchains."

Bitcoin is not the only blockchain project, although it was the first. Bitcoin uses a set of technoligies (cryptographic signatures, x, y, z, etc) to solve a specific set of problems (e.g. wealth storage and peer-to-peer digital cash). Other blockchain projects use a different set of technology to solve other problems. One example is ethereum, created in 2015 by vitalik buterin to be a world computer. It is worth mentioning that cryptocurrencies are evolving - they are not static - because developers are working on improving the technology, and this in turn affects the set of problems a certain cryptocurrency can solve. Obviously there is a strong relationship between the technology and the real world use case, and since different cryptocurrencies have different techonloghy their use cases differ too.

> maybe include a quote from multicoin capital or erik voorhees (listed again to podcast on epicenter where he talks about the hack - there he mentions that he does not think there will be only one blockchain.)


## use cases and visions of the future

todo write about crypto basics and some cool projects.

- Bitcoin: P2P digital cash, a store of value and digital gold.
- Ethereum: A world computer with smart contracts.
- XRP: Global remittances, fast and cheap.
- Augur: Decentralized prediction market.
- Storj: Rent your hard drive.

how much should go in here? I'm not sure. we could write something about bitcoin 2008 paper, the price jumps, etc. a brief history of the most important steps, ending with lightning. then describe ethereums goal and the dao hack and ICOs. then mention Ripple Augur Storj in one sentence each.


## trade-offs and different choices on parameters to optimize

we established that blockchain projects can differ in their visions of the future as well as in their use-cases (i.e. they try to solve different problems). Can two projects co-exist even though they have they have similar visions and use-cases? Yes. They are simply competitors. Among competing blockchain projects, however, there need not emerge a single winner (although netwoek effects exists) since two cruptocurrencies can serve different customer segments.

To understand why there is an equillibrium in which several blockchain projects with the same vision and use cases co-exist, consider that blockchains have a set of parameters. examples of such parameters are level of decentralization, tx cost, confirmation time, througput, inflation rate, permissions etc. It is impossible to optimize for all parameters. Trade offs must be made. When functionality is increased, security might usffer. When the level of decentralization is decreased, it might be possible to increase throughput.
((For example, EOS is less decentralized in block production than ethereum, and for this gets a higher performance. Another example is that bitcoin has a lower feature set (payments) vs ethereum (smart contracts and a world computer) but enjoys higher security since it bitcoin has not been hacked whilst Etherum has - arguably due to the complexity of the scripting language and functionality Etherum tries to achieve.))
Thus there is an equilibrium where there are several blockchains trying to serve the same customer need but they do so in different ways.

## different communities

[comment]: # "this is slightly related to (b) why indexing makes sense in particular for crypto. but i dont feel like i have the space to elaborate on it over there. maybe there is space. then this subsection can be moved there."

each coin has a community - almost an ideology. or at least a set of beliefs about the world they share. for example:

- **bitcoin** is convervative, as changes to the protocol is done only by reaching consensus within the community. the design of bitcoin has roots in austrian economy, so bitcoiners often have similar ideas about economics (at least more homogenous than two random persons).
- **ethereum** consists many web developers, partly because ethereums goal of creating a world computer is attractive to them, and partly because ethereum's scripting language "Solidity" resembles the popular web programming langauge "Javascript".
- **ripple**... todo sid write something.
- **EOS** tries to make trade-offs on decentralization and transaction throughput (korrekt?)
- **dogecoin**, a coin that is meant to be funny, it is literally a joke.

[comment]: # " To quote multicoin.capital a bet on DPoS is a bet on a few things: 1. There are certain applications that require high throughput and low latency on a neutral database. 2. Not all distributed systems need to be that distributed so as to able to withstand full-frontal government assault."

market forces will decide which project is important and which is not. who will win? we don't know. our product is bullish the entire crypto market. our product does not single out any particular project, instead, it holds the project that the market currently thinks will be of the highest value in the future.

[comment]: # "below i re-emphaisze the diversification benefit of our index. I need to take it up again here because it is not until now that the listener understands the point about community or identity."
most people today hold 1-3 coins, even though there are thousands of coins. an investor rarely hold only 1-3 stocks. as the cryptocurrency market matures people will probably hold a diversified basket of coins - especially the persons who seek good risk-adjusted returns and doesn't care about the community or identity of a particular coin.

## disruption

software is easting the world and cryptocurrencies might disrupt several industries.

# ev. trade and trust

(från ett abstrakt perspektiv)

todovip write about the below into a paragraph.

why are blockchains useful? firstly, blockhains are tamper-proof. secondly, consider the sequential ideas below.

1. **trust is needed for trade.** if two parties want to transact but do not trust each other, it will be hard to execute the trade. the seller might worry that the payment will not arrive in time. the larger the transaction's value the more trust is needed.
2. **today we use trusted third parties**. for example house brokers and stock brokers, whom are employed by large corporations with regonizable names and logotypes. their role is to increase confidence of the transacting parties, so that their fears are reduced or eliminated. what these companies consist of is essentially trained people who perform manual checks.
3. **a blockchain digitize trust**. it does so partly because the data cannot be tampered with - if something is in the blockchain it will stay there. <!-- todo maybe write more on this point. it is the one the reader knoew the least about -->
4. **digitalization will continue**. the last decade we hav automated many factory jobs with robots and computers. it has increased our effiency and standards of living.
5. **people's manual work can be replaced with blockchain technology.** there are benefits to replace some of the trusted third party companies with techno: use cases, visions, trade-offs and communitieslogy instead. these benefits are higher speed, lower cost and fewer errors.
6. given the trend of **digitalization**, combined with the fact that **blockchain** can replace some of the manual work done by trusted third parties, the logical conclusion is that we are likely to see an **increased use of blockchain technology**.

[comment]: # "I think the slide can be be these numbered points but only the bolded text. and probably refreashing these statements. "


# myths  arguments against cryptocurrencies

## volatile

"it is volatile". yes. here is how volatile it is compared to other asset classes.
<!--- we indirectly say it is another asset class, and we put some numbers on the critique so people can see the vol is not so bad. -->

> On a side note it’s worth to mention that the large part of the vol. is attributed mainly from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies huge price surge, not capturing downside risk.


## bubble

"it might be a bubble". yes we know.

- it is early stage. it is uncertain.
- our downside is capped (a fixed amount of time and money will be spent). but the upside is unlimited (if blockchains revolutionize one industry the ROI will be ridiliously high). [^footnote_about_options]
- that's you should make a small bet early, with small portoflio weights.

[^footnote_about_options]: it might be a bubble that pops (goes to zero). it might be the beginning of a tech that explodes and disrupts finance, insurande, and other industries (goes to infinity).  employees and investors in axlantic hold a call option. so we love this volatility / risk / uncertainty since the value of a call option increases with volatility.       the same idea expressed in a more theoreical way: a call option increases in value when the volatility (uncertainty) is high.     investing time and money in this company can be considered as an option on the cryptocurrency market. all employees and investors in this company all hold an option, and one reason this option is valuable is precisely because of the volatility - uncertainty - of whether this technology a bubble about to burst or if it is a techn that will disrupt.


## illegal activity

[comment]: # "i have one content per paragraph here. 1) educate listener what people refer to 2) say that it is not the technologys fault, it is simply a medium 3) even if you blame the medium, please blame usd cash for all illegal activity and discuss that problem rather than the tiny amounts."

Bitcoin is linked with Silk Road, where the purchase of illegal drugs was possible. This gives Bitcoin a bad reputation that it does not deserve.

Criminals have use and will always use technology when performing illegal activities. The technology they use can be cars, cell phones, cash, bitcoin, etc.
We rarely blaim the US dollar or post offices which both facilitate high volume of illegal trades, e.g. guns bought with cash. ((The same logic should apply to other currencies.))

Researchers estimate todo percent of all bitcoin transactions come from illegal activity, [^source-illegal-btc]
whereas todo percent of all Cash in USD cash transactions come from illegal acticity. [^source-illegal-cash]

[^source-illegal-btc]: todo find this.

[^source-illegal-cash]: todo google and insert a trust worthy source.

## more sections

todo: read https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Myths and include some of these, such as
- 1
- 2
- 7
- 17
- 33
but try to make it less bitcoin focues and more crypto focues, if possible.

## no intrisic value

above we noted that a blockchain digitize trust, and can be used to replace current intermediaries, so from this use case it has value.

moreover, it also has value because it's a network in which value can be transfered - the internet is a network where information can be sent.

> Another way to think about this is to consider the value of bitcoin the global network, rather than each bitcoin in isolation. The value of an individual telephone is derived from the network it is connected to. If there was no phone network, a telephone would be useless. Similarly the value of an individual bitcoin derives from the global network of bitcoin-enabled merchants, exchanges, wallets, etc... Just like a phone is necessary to transmit vocal information through the network, a bitcoin is necessary to transmit economic information through the network.
> https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Myths#Bitcoin_has_no_intrinsic_value_.28unlike_some_other_things.29

## it does not work today

[comment]: # "i dont know if this section should be part of the presentation."

bitcoin has never been hacked, you can send and recieve transactions instantly world-wide (and they settle in 10 min not T+2). there are problem on how hard it is to use and that only a few take it as means of payment.

progress is being made, but it's not done yet.
and it is ok that it not every little detail is solved yet. this was the case both with cars and electricity. [^antonoop-infrastructure-inversion]

[^antonoop-infrastructure-inversion]:  andreas antonop has a good chapter about infrastructure inversion in his non tech book. at first they say "it is so slow, it cant work, look" because the car tries to work in the current infrastructure of kullersten and horses hit. when you build roads for cars, both the horse and the car can go on that road, however, the car flourishes. that is an example of infrastructure inversion.   another example is using electricity in your home. in the beginning it was only right people and nuts who had it. your house could be burnt down, etc. because the infrastructure was gas pipes... same principle as in the car-horse-example.

# The case for crypto in an institutional portfolio

[commnet]: # "this is a last bullish section. i think the arguments and counter arguments is needed. but from sales perspective, we need a sales punch in order to transition to sectino 3 why following an index is hard"

todovip: write a bullish section.

## Portolio thinking

When considering whether or not to invest in an asset, an investor should study the asset not in isolation but rather as a part of the entire portfolio. It does not make sense to exclude Twitter from SP500 simply because the stock is too risky for one's risk preference. Rather, one should compare the SP500 with Twitter included vs the SP500 with Twitter excluded. After comparing the two portfolios sector allocation, risk-return profiles, etc then the investor can make a decision of whether to exclude Twitter or not from his portoflio.

<!---
[commnent]: # "the following text is from sid. it is a less concise version of what jacob wrote above."
> Historical volatility is something we can measure, so how does e.g. Bitcoin volatility measure up, just to give perspective both oil and stocks included in the s&p500 such as Twitter have proven to be more volatile than Bitcoin historically. Ask yourself why is higher vol. accepted when it comes to oil markets and individual stocks and not when it comes to cryptocurrencies?."
todo: feels like cherry picking a few stocks and assets. maybe do some data anlaysis here, take top 100 and stocks in sp500 and say where btc lies. jacob can do this.
> If not plotted and compared to other investable assets we see vol. statements opposing cryptocurrency as an potential investment as ignorance, in all investments one should invest in accordance with one's own risk adjusted acceptance, where risk can be lowered by diversification, more on this later but to keep it simple, why not invest 1, 2 or 3% of current portfolio in cryptocurrency? Think of the downside risk compared to the upside potential here. Always look at investments as a bundle i.e. part of a portfolio and not in isolation. Would you only buy one stock?    Historically adding 1, 3 or even 10% exposure to Bitcoin as a part of your portfolio only raise vol. very little with higher returns.
-->

## Low correlations

![Digital assets and traditional financial assets exhibit low - sometimes negative - correlations. Hence digital assets can be used to diversify a traditional portfolio.](path to file containg 1 or 2 correlation matrix plots.)

The primary conclusion to draw from this matrix is that
the correlation between virtual currencies and traditional assets are far below one,
hence they can be used to diversify a traditional portfolio.
It seems like the crypto asset class exhibit different return patterns than traditional financial assets such as gold and stocks.

The secondary conclusion to draw from this matrix is that
the correlation between different virtual currencies are below one,
reflecting the fact that these these currencies are different from each other.
This correlation between assets in BlockchainX is a reason to hold our certificate,
since a strategy of buying merely Bitcoin and Ethereum would miss out on the other 8 assets
which are diversifiers thanks to their low (and sometimes negative) correlations.
Moreover, only buying two assets rather than a basket is sub-optimal due to performance reversals. <!-- sehway into next topic-->

[slide-comment]: # "only plots. no text. well, only the caption."

[comment]: # "We write _below one_ and not _low_ or _negative_ because it is proven that assets with corr < 1 leads to a more diversified portfolio, it is not necessary that they are < 0 or close to zero."

[comment]: # "It is a stylized fact in finance that correlations are time variant. The correation matrix looks different depending on which data we use. todo: include a gif of corr matrices or a correlation time series plot. we can do this in a blog post, it is too much including it in the report. only quants will think of that as critique."

## Performance reversals

[comment]: # "Statistically speaking this section is not different from concluding the correlations are low. however, it is a nice sales argument and makes it super clear for an investor why they want to have a basket."

For a long period Bitcoin outperformed almost all other virtual currencies in the top 10 index.
During the price drop of Bitcoin in January 2018, three of the top 10 digital assets - EOS, NEO and Stellar - realized positive returns.
Only twice in 12 months has the top-performing coin repeated the feat of being the best performer in the following month.[^ref-12months]
These performance reversals clearly demonstrate the benefits of diversification. It also provides a good reason to buy a slice of the market, instead of trying to pick a few virtual currencies and hope they will perform.

[slide-comment]: # "I think the slide should be table with coins on y axis, months on x axis, and then just plot a few sample months of the top t coins. So you can see the name is different every month. maybe use t=5 or so."

[^ref-12months]: todo: which 12 months? was it the most recent 12 months? or during 2017?

> During the price decrease of Bitcoin in January 2018, three of the top 10 digital assets - EOS, NEO and Stellar - realized positive returns. This variation in performance during bad times for the asset class is the cornerstone of diversification benefits that investors enjoy by including a proposed top 10 digital asset ETN in their portfolios.

> The case for diversification is further reinforced by regular occurrence of performance reversals as well as rare occurence of top performer persistence. Only twice in 12 months has the top-performing digital asset repeated the feat of being the best performer in the following month. Diversification has become a stylized fact regarding every asset class in the investable universe. Digital assets are no exception.

## Expansion of the efficient frontier

Let us be crystal clear in our analysis of adding virtual currencies to a traditional portfolio, by re-visiting the traditional "efficient frontier plot".
The reason why a correlation matrix matter to an investor is that the correlation structure allows him to enjoy higher risk-adjusted returns. When the correlation between the assets are lowered, the portfolio's volatility is lowered too.
So what happens when we add cryptocurrencies (market in the figure as crosses) to the universe of investable assets? Cryptohtmlcurrencies are marked in the figure as crosses.
Thanks the statistical properties of these assets - namely their returns, volatility and correlation structure - the efficient frontier expands to the left. This expanded efficient frontier is drawn as a dashed gray line in the figure. Thus investors who include cryptocurrencies in their portfolio can enjoy better risk-adjusted returns, which is a logical result since adding choices always leaves an investor better off.

## Traditional portfolio w and w/o BLX

Let's put the theorical argument above into an example using historical data.

[comment]: # "below are extracts from crypto institutional portoflio pdf. we should make a similar comparison! but instead with our product, not with only bitcoin. todo: jacob do some data anlaysis."

todo insert path to file after the analysis is done.
![](time series plot w two lines: portfolio w BLX and w/o BLX, starting at $100)
todo: insert a table with return, vol and return/vol as well.

## Traditional portfolio w and w/o 3 to 7 percent BLX allocation

Due to its superior returns, BLX ends up being qq % of the entire portfolio. This is not what we advice. We suggest a small portoflio weight to BLX. Below we have the same comparison as above, but after rebalancing so that BLX are kept around 5% of the entire portfolio (recall: portfolio thinking above).

More formally, we have a target weight of 5% with 0.40 tolerance rate so that whenever the weight of BLX goes above 7% it is rebalanced down to 5% and whenever the weight of BLX goes below 3% it is rebalanced up to 5%.
For simplicity we assume zero trading cost for selling (or buying) BLX and buying (or selling) the traditional portfolio.

The effect this tolerance based allocation strategy has is shown in the figure.

![When we use tolarance rebalancing, the wieght of BLX is kept close to the target rate of 5%.](path to file. it is similar to bitwise area plot, however, we put them side by side to make the comparison easier. the purpose is to pedagogically show what the difference is between using tolerance rebalncing and not. the graph allow us to spend much less time explaining.)

* BAL: A balanced portfolio of 95% TRD and 5% BLX. Rebalanced whenever weight in BLX go above 7% or below 3%.

## good text from the report

>This report explores the case for including a small but meaningful
>allocation to cryptoassets in a diversified portfolio. Specifically, it examines
>the impact that a 1%, 5%, and 10% allocation to Bitcoin would have had on
>a traditional 60% equity/40% bond portfolio since Jan. 1, 2014.

>The potential impact was large: With a 5% allocation, for instance, the

>doubled, and the maximum drawdown was substantially reduced.

>The study looked at the period Jan. 1, 2014 through March 31, 2018. This period was chosen because it
>captures two of the worst bear markets in Bitcoin history: The 85% pullback from January 2014 through
>January 2015, and the 64% decline from December 2017 through the conclusion of the study in March
>2018. The study considered looking at returns since Bitcoin’s inception on publicly available exchanges in
>2010, but the early returns of Bitcoin were so high that they skew the analysis. In 2013, for example,
>Bitcoin’s price rose 5,507% (see table). The chosen start date captures what amounts to the worst
>historical scenario for adding Bitcoin to a portfolio.

>Despite this (intentionally) adverse timing, the study found that a systematic allocation to Bitcoin
>significantly increased the portfolio’s risk-adjusted returns, assuming a diligent rebalancing strategy was in
>place. In fact, a small allocation to Bitcoin achieved this result without increasing the risk profile of the
>portfolio in any meaningful way.

>The results were remarkable: The “Quarterly Rebalanced Portfolio” captured similar returns as the HODL
>Portfolio (58.51% vs. 67.70%), but did so with less than half the risk (9.0% vs. 19.8%). Quarterly
>rebalancing also massively reduced the maximum drawdown, which fell from -32.68% to just -9.25%.
>This drawdown was actually lower than the maximum drawdown experienced by the Traditional Portfolio
>(which didn’t hold Bitcoin at all).

>In an effort to better constrain Bitcoin’s weight in the portfolio, the study looked at a Tolerance-Based
>rebalancing strategy using a 50% tolerance. That meant rebalancing the 5% Bitcoin allocation any time it hit 7.5% or 2.5%.


# Virtual currencies are an emerging asset class

[comment]: # "the text below is taken from report and nearly summarize all the number crunching done in the previous section. i think it is useful to have a final _punch_ to conclude this section of Why crypto."

> In our view, digital assets represent a new emerging asset class, which by construction is not comparable to any asset class previously in existence. We argue that digital assets are a good example of a decoupling phenomenon, just as in case of emerging markets. Thus, they are good diversifiers of risk exposure to traditional asset classes.
