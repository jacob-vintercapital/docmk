# Our product

We have created a diversified index that tracks the prices of cryptocurrencies, in a similar way that the SP500 tracks the prices of equities. It is called BlockchainX Index.

We will issue an exchange-traded note that follows our index. It will be traded on regulated exchanges to provide retail and institutional investors a diversified exposure to the cryptocurrency market.
