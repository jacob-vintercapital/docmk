Indexing and traditional finance A passive investor does not try to beat the market, instead, he invests in vehicles like index funds and ETFs tracking the SP500. An active investor , by contrast, tries to outsmart the market by making active bets such as trying to pich the right stock. These bets make it possible for an active investor to perform better or worse than the market. The last 20 years a strong trend has emerged within the financial markets - passive investing is on the rise.

Academic empirical studies have shown that trying to beat the market is an unprofitable strategy. For an overview of the literature see for example [Fama's 1952 article][fama-1952] in the Journal of Finance. To understand why passive investing beats active, consider the following sequential logical argumentation, written in the form of three statements: Active managers cannot collectively beat the market. Sub-groups of active investors do not beat their index. Top performers do not stay top performers. [fama-1952]: todo insert link to paper effient cpaital markets. The first statement is just plain arithmetic, and was proved by Sharpe in 1991 . Some active managers must have returns higher the market, and some must have returns lower than the market. As a collective, they will have a return equal to the market. After including fees, however, the sum of all active investors will be beaten by the market due to trading costs. Secondly, active managers investing in a certain style (e.g. stocks with low high dividend yield or small cap growth stocks) do not beat their sub-index. This make sense because almost any style can be replicated with an index, and since indexes are less costly than portfolio managers an investor can get the same return for a lower fee. The last line of defence for active investing is that whilst the two previous statements are true, there exists people who can make the right judgement call and beat the market consistently. Data suggests the opposite. Every year, some investors do indeed beat the market, but these investors are different persons from year to year. By ranking the portfolio managers in one period, and then studying how they performed in the following periods, it is evident that the top performers do not stay top performers. This is logical, since risk taking can give extreme returns - sometimes extremely positive and sometimes extremely negative. The performance of active money managers provides the best evidence yet that indexing may be the best strategy for many investors. /Damodaran, Professor of Finance at NYU. Diversification Portfolio theory has had a huge impact on finance. Markovitz, who won the 1990 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, invented portfolio theory in 1952 with his famous paper titled Portfolio Selection published in the Journal of Finance. Portfolio theory changed the lens through which assets are considered. Before Markovitz, investors held a small number of stocks and tended to evaluate their stocks in isolation. Today, almost all investors evaluates their portfolio as a whole before buying or selling assets. ![Investors can recieve better risk-adjusted returns by diversifying their holdings.](todo insert path to simple markovitz graph with only one type of assets. SP500 can be the ORP.) To understand why portfolios are attractive investments, we can utilize an \"efficient frontier plot\". Any textbook on portfolio theory contain a version of this graph. In the plot we see a collection of assets with their historical volatility on the x-axis and a their expected return on the y-axis. Holding one of these assets will give the investor a certain risk (volatility) for a certain reward (return). Investors want high returns and low volatility, so the upper left corner is an ideal place to be. When comparing assets agsinst each other there is, of course, a trade-off between risk and reward: taking on more risk (by for example selling some T-bills and investing in a startup) does increase the expected return but also leads to higher volatility. The efficient frontier is the set of (return, volatility)-points the investor can get if they buy a portfolio of assets, and it is illustrated with a solid black line in the figure. Every single point on the efficient frontier is a portfolio the investor can have. The efficient frontier is located close to the ideal upper left corner, reflecting the fact that portfolios are more attractive than owning a single asset. The reason for this is diversification. ![](corr plot of sp500 and 10 or 20 assets.) Correlation is the driver of diversification. When the assets are correlated less than 1.00 with each other, it is possible to increase the risk-adjusted returns by diversifying. The lower the correlations between the assets, the more this solid line will expand to the upper left corner. Here is an important but subtle point: Even though an asset like gold might have inferior risk adjusted returns to some stocks, it can be rational for an investor to include gold in his portfolio because doing so improves the portfolio as a whole. Diversification stems from correlation, and if gold has a low correlation with stocks then including it will lead to better risk-adjusted returns of the entire portfolio. Indexing and cryptocurrencies Portfolio theory has not influenced the cryptocurrency market yet. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies, and many hundreds are traded on large exchanges. But out of the few people that have bought cryptocurrencies, owning only 1-3 different cryptocurrencies is the norm. Just like different companies operate in distinct sectors, different cryptocurrencies try to solve different problems - some focus on building a general purpose scripting language and others on integrating their software with the current banking system. Just like stocks, cryptocurrencies have a lower correlation that makes them suitable to be included in a portfolio. As seen in the figure, the correlation between cryptocurrencies is around 0.20 which is lower than the correlation between stocks.

Cryptocurrencies will do to value what the internet did to information. (infoga fr\u00e5n talk 1 ur boken internet of money vol 2) Email was the first real application of the internet. Payments is the first real application of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Another similarity between bitcoin and email is that if you know someones email or bitcoin adress then you can send them information or value instantly across the globe, but it can only be sent if your password or private key. The internet have disrupted many industries (e.g. media). Cryptocurrencies will disrupt many industries (e.g. finance). Different cryptocurrencies have different use cases. There will be multiple winners. But who? Other similarities to internet are: before the internet, sending information was done differently based on whether it was a photo, document, ... before cryptocurrencies, sending value was done differently based on your location, the amount you sent (banking networks for fast transfers or large tranfers exists but not for both). internet and bitconi are networks that can handle eveything. few people understand the technology you don't need to understand how it works in order to use it. hard to use (more on this later) but it becomes easier every day mostly geeks use it mostly geeks know about the potential future use cases many different projects exists, each with different goals a lot of vc money (include data point) brief history of money my ideas - vad detta avsnitt ska f\u00f6rmedla the history of money provides important lessons: money is needed for trade. it was invented everywhere around the globe. we have used many forms of money: seashells in some places (not beaches) coins in others. some things are more moeny than others. for something to be used as money it should satisfy a few proprties: x y z. coins are more popular than other things because it fulfils proprties nicely. we moved from coins to paper money because it was more convinient. when moving to paper money, mistakes were made over and over again (e.g. print a lot => get inflation) fiat money is not backed by anything. it has no intrisic value. we simply agree to use it (to price goods in it and accept it to settle financial oblications). the fact we all agree on it is what makes it work. self fulfilling. there are good reasons to believe some people will stop using their fiat money and move (in part or in whole) to use cryptocurrencies, because (a) we have changed it before (b) it is more convinient (digital, borderless, instant, etc.) (c) it is a better form of money in the sense that it ticks more boxes (see \"proprties\" and the fact many fiat currencies are shitty due to inflation arising from printing money ((and high gov spending)).). text Money had to be invented for trade. Before money societies relied on gifts and barter, both of which severly limits trade. Gifts limits a transaction's value and whom we can trade with, since knowing the person or having a history of successful gift exchanges would be required for valuable trades to take place. ((Another drawback with gifts are that they rely on humans remembering the quality and amount of the good which was recieved, and this is a common source of conflicts.)) Barter limits the liquidity and frequence of trade, because if paying in-kind is the only option then both the buyer and the seller must be willing to buy and sell each other goods simoultaneuously. This requires a coincidence of wants, which is unlikely. For example, what should the fisherman do when he has caught more than he is able to eat? Perhaps the fisherman need clothe, but if his society relies on barter then he must find a tailor today - otherwise the fish will be worthless. The tailor might not be hungry, but in this case the fisherman might be able to trade the fish for nuts, the nuts for beer, and the beer for clothes. Obviously the coincidence of wants introduces liquidity and accounting problems: will there be a path from fish to clothes via trading, and what are the appropriate exchange ratios for all goods? In an economy with 100 goods there are 4950 prices to keep track of. Moreover, barter is impossible for the musician who needs to pay rent to his house landlord. Money solves these problems. All goods can be priced in terms of only one other good so that there are not thousands of exchange rates to keep track of (money is a unit of account). And the musician can recieve money when he plays the piano at a bar (money is a medium of exchange). He can use these money later to pay his rent (money is a store of value). Money can be defined in terms of its functions as a a medium of exchange, store of value and unit of account. Anything that fulfills these properties can be used as money. Throughout history we have used many forms of money: seashells, knifes, cows, alcohol, and large stones formed in the shape of doughnuts. All of these fall under the category of commodity money. All commodity money is easy to understand, and most of them function reasonably well as a unit of account. Some commodities are more money than others, thanks to their proporties such as look, weight, divisibility, and scarcity. Gold and solver coins was introduced in 600 BC, and later on many societies used coins that had been issued by the king. Paper money was used in China during the 11th century due to the physical hurdles with commodity money. Gold and silver merchants gave out reciepts which could redeemed for a certain amount of the commodity. This form of money fall under the category of representative money. The reciepts were in essence IOUs because it was the person who held the reciept who had the right to redeem it. Paper money came to Europe during the 13th century, and by the 18th century gold coins had been replaced by paper money backed by gold. This monetary system is referred to as the gold standard. The paper notes were backed by gold in the sense that they were convertible into a certain amount of gold. In the 20th century almost all countries used the gold standard and made these notes legal tender. todo skriv sista stycket mha denna text fr\u00e5n wiki och videon https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNo7MDN5-0g \"After World War II and the Bretton Woods Conference, most countries adopted fiat currencies that were fixed to the U.S. dollar.

Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts, such as taxes, in a particular country or socio-economic context.[1][2][3] The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value and sometimes, a standard of deferred payment.[4][5] Any item or verifiable record that fulfills these functions can be considered as money. jag skriver om den som: Money is any item (or verifiable record) that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts ((in a particular region or context)). The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. Anything which fulfils these functions can be considered to be money. Some things are more money than others. From the definition of money, it is obvious that some items or some verifiable records function better than others. Seashells cannot be used as money on a beach, because it is not scarce. Cows are worse than metal coins because cows takes time to transport due its weight, difficult to divide and not fungible (two cows are different). for something to function well as money it must satisfy a few important properties. it must be scarce, easy to verify and hard to fake. insert counterexamples from the book age of cryptocurrency, d\u00e4r st\u00e5r det typ \"sn\u00e4ckor \u00e4r inte scarce p\u00e5 en beach s\u00e5 det funkar inte\" och andra enkla f\u00f6rklaringar till dessa properties. compare gold, collectibles, bitcoin. make a table. googla s\u00e5 hittar du m\u00e5nga har gjort det redan. a brief history of bitcoin sid kanske kan hj\u00e4lpa? g\u00f6r denna kort f\u00f6r det \u00e4r inte j\u00e4tteintressant. viktigaste att f\u00e5 med \u00e4r at tkedjan inte blivit hackad, att det ligger mkt wealth d\u00e4ri, samt att priset har fallit massa g\u00e5nger. ev ox\u00e5 bitcoin obituaries n\u00e4r k\u00e4nda m\u00e4nniskor sagt att bicoin \u00e4r d\u00f6tt. take from medium post https://medium.com/@nic__carter/visions-of-bitcoin-4b7b7cbcd24c image https://u.cubeupload.com/daedalus_42/btctimeline3.png 2009 genesis block whitepaper 2010 mt gox opens silk road opens satoshi becomes quiet 2011 BTCUSD = 1 wikileaks accept btc mt gox first hacked. vad \u00e4r diffen mot n\u00e4r den blev hackad 4 real och dog? 2012 ?? first halving, menar dom i block rewarD? coinbase founded 2013 ?? accidental hard fork and rollback first ico held by mastercoin ross ullbrich arrested mt gox shut down IRS tax btc as property 2014 ethereum crowdsale microsoft accept btc (k\u00e4lla? f\u00f6r alla datorer?) 2015 NY bitlecense EU call btc a currency CFTC calls it a commodity ?? bitcoin xt released 2016 segwit proposed second halving 2017 tx volume usd 1 billion per day block reaches capacity NY agreement bundles 2x and segwit. segwit activates. segwit 2x canceled. fork ETF denied CME btc future grafen inneh\u00e5ller ngra fel tex \"goldman bitcoin trading desk\" och oviktiga saker s\u00e5som craig wright. b\u00f6r hitta annan graf och annan historik. men ngra saker ovan kanske kan var med. todo take from http://historyofbitcoin.org/ and https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Category:History some properties of bitcoin maybe i should make a table? property; explanation of property; example of a bad thing; bitcoin; fiat from reddit text below taken from reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/61s75o/rbitcoin_faq_newcomers_please_read/ Limited Supply - There will only ever be 21,000,000 bitcoins created and they are issued in a predictable fashion, you can view the inflation schedule here. Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary. Open source - Bitcoin code is fully auditable. You can read the source code yourself here. Accountable - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are seen by everyone. Decentralized - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how Bittorrent works. Censorship resistant - No one can prevent you from interacting with the bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see Operation Chokepoint. Push system - There are no chargebacks in bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoins reside has the authority to move them. Low fee - Transactions fees can vary between a few cents and a few dollars depending on network demand and how much priority you wish to assign to the transaction. Most wallets calculate the fee automatically but you can view current fees here. Borderless - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is globally distributed. Trustless - Bitcoin solved the Byzantine's Generals Problem which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work. Pseudonymous - No need to expose personal information when purchasing with cash or transacting. Secure - Encrypted cryptographically and can\u2019t be brute forced or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets. Programmable - Individual units of bitcoin can be programmed to transfer based on certain criteria being met Nearly instant - From a few seconds to a few minutes depending on need for confirmations. After a few confirmations transactions are irreversible. Peer-to-peer - No intermediaries with a cut, no need for trusted third parties. Portable - Bitcoins are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold. They can even be transported by simply remembering a string of words for wallet recovery. Scalable - Each bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimals allowing it to grow in value while still accommodating micro-transactions. Designed Money - Bitcoin was created to fit all the fundamental properties of money better than gold or fiat from bitcoin wiki Unlike gold, bitcoins are: Easy to transfer Easy to secure Easy to verify Easy to granulate Unlike fiat currencies, bitcoins are: Predictable and limited in supply Not controlled by a central authority (such as The United States Federal Reserve) Not debt-based Unlike electronic fiat currency systems, bitcoins are: Potentially anonymous Freeze-proof Faster to transfer Cheaper to transfer different blockchains Bitcoin is not the only blockchain project, although it was the first. Bitcoin uses a set of technoligies (cryptographic signatures, x, y, z, etc) to solve a specific set of problems (e.g. wealth storage and peer-to-peer digital cash). Other blockchain projects use a different set of technology to solve other problems. One example is ethereum, created in 2015 by vitalik buterin to be a world computer. It is worth mentioning that cryptocurrencies are evolving - they are not static - because developers are working on improving the technology, and this in turn affects the set of problems a certain cryptocurrency can solve. Obviously there is a strong relationship between the technology and the real world use case, and since different cryptocurrencies have different techonloghy their use cases differ too. maybe include a quote from multicoin capital or erik voorhees (listed again to podcast on epicenter where he talks about the hack - there he mentions that he does not think there will be only one blockchain.) use cases and visions of the future todo write about crypto basics and some cool projects. Bitcoin: P2P digital cash, a store of value and digital gold. Ethereum: A world computer with smart contracts. XRP: Global remittances, fast and cheap. Augur: Decentralized prediction market. Storj: Rent your hard drive. how much should go in here? I'm not sure. we could write something about bitcoin 2008 paper, the price jumps, etc. a brief history of the most important steps, ending with lightning. then describe ethereums goal and the dao hack and ICOs. then mention Ripple Augur Storj in one sentence each. trade-offs and different choices on parameters to optimize we established that blockchain projects can differ in their visions of the future as well as in their use-cases (i.e. they try to solve different problems). Can two projects co-exist even though they have they have similar visions and use-cases? Yes. They are simply competitors. Among competing blockchain projects, however, there need not emerge a single winner (although netwoek effects exists) since two cruptocurrencies can serve different customer segments. To understand why there is an equillibrium in which several blockchain projects with the same vision and use cases co-exist, consider that blockchains have a set of parameters. examples of such parameters are level of decentralization, tx cost, confirmation time, througput, inflation rate, permissions etc. It is impossible to optimize for all parameters. Trade offs must be made. When functionality is increased, security might usffer. When the level of decentralization is decreased, it might be possible to increase throughput. ((For example, EOS is less decentralized in block production than ethereum, and for this gets a higher performance. Another example is that bitcoin has a lower feature set (payments) vs ethereum (smart contracts and a world computer) but enjoys higher security since it bitcoin has not been hacked whilst Etherum has - arguably due to the complexity of the scripting language and functionality Etherum tries to achieve.)) Thus there is an equilibrium where there are several blockchains trying to serve the same customer need but they do so in different ways. different communities each coin has a community - almost an ideology. or at least a set of beliefs about the world they share. for example: bitcoin is convervative, as changes to the protocol is done only by reaching consensus within the community. the design of bitcoin has roots in austrian economy, so bitcoiners often have similar ideas about economics (at least more homogenous than two random persons). ethereum consists many web developers, partly because ethereums goal of creating a world computer is attractive to them, and partly because ethereum's scripting language \"Solidity\" resembles the popular web programming langauge \"Javascript\". ripple ... todo sid write something. EOS tries to make trade-offs on decentralization and transaction throughput (korrekt?) dogecoin , a coin that is meant to be funny, it is literally a joke. market forces will decide which project is important and which is not. who will win? we don't know. our product is bullish the entire crypto market. our product does not single out any particular project, instead, it holds the project that the market currently thinks will be of the highest value in the future. most people today hold 1-3 coins, even though there are thousands of coins. an investor rarely hold only 1-3 stocks. as the cryptocurrency market matures people will probably hold a diversified basket of coins - especially the persons who seek good risk-adjusted returns and doesn't care about the community or identity of a particular coin. disruption software is easting the world and cryptocurrencies might disrupt several industries. ev. trade and trust (fr\u00e5n ett abstrakt perspektiv) todovip write about the below into a paragraph. why are blockchains useful? firstly, blockhains are tamper-proof. secondly, consider the sequential ideas below. trust is needed for trade. if two parties want to transact but do not trust each other, it will be hard to execute the trade. the seller might worry that the payment will not arrive in time. the larger the transaction's value the more trust is needed. today we use trusted third parties . for example house brokers and stock brokers, whom are employed by large corporations with regonizable names and logotypes. their role is to increase confidence of the transacting parties, so that their fears are reduced or eliminated. what these companies consist of is essentially trained people who perform manual checks. a blockchain digitize trust . it does so partly because the data cannot be tampered with - if something is in the blockchain it will stay there. digitalization will continue . the last decade we hav automated many factory jobs with robots and computers. it has increased our effiency and standards of living. people's manual work can be replaced with blockchain technology. there are benefits to replace some of the trusted third party companies with techno: use cases, visions, trade-offs and communitieslogy instead. these benefits are higher speed, lower cost and fewer errors. given the trend of digitalization , combined with the fact that blockchain can replace some of the manual work done by trusted third parties, the logical conclusion is that we are likely to see an increased use of blockchain technology . myths arguments against cryptocurrencies volatile \"it is volatile\". yes. here is how volatile it is compared to other asset classes. On a side note it\u2019s worth to mention that the large part of the vol. is attributed mainly from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies huge price surge, not capturing downside risk. bubble \"it might be a bubble\". yes we know. it is early stage. it is uncertain. our downside is capped (a fixed amount of time and money will be spent). but the upside is unlimited (if blockchains revolutionize one industry the ROI will be ridiliously high). [^footnote_about_options] that's you should make a small bet early, with small portoflio weights. [^footnote_about_options]: it might be a bubble that pops (goes to zero). it might be the beginning of a tech that explodes and disrupts finance, insurande, and other industries (goes to infinity). employees and investors in axlantic hold a call option. so we love this volatility / risk / uncertainty since the value of a call option increases with volatility. the same idea expressed in a more theoreical way: a call option increases in value when the volatility (uncertainty) is high. investing time and money in this company can be considered as an option on the cryptocurrency market. all employees and investors in this company all hold an option, and one reason this option is valuable is precisely because of the volatility - uncertainty - of whether this technology a bubble about to burst or if it is a techn that will disrupt. illegal activity Bitcoin is linked with Silk Road, where the purchase of illegal drugs was possible. This gives Bitcoin a bad reputation that it does not deserve. Criminals have use and will always use technology when performing illegal activities. The technology they use can be cars, cell phones, cash, bitcoin, etc. We rarely blaim the US dollar or post offices which both facilitate high volume of illegal trades, e.g. guns bought with cash. ((The same logic should apply to other currencies.)) Researchers estimate todo percent of all bitcoin transactions come from illegal activity, [^source-illegal-btc] whereas todo percent of all Cash in USD cash transactions come from illegal acticity.

Another way to think about this is to consider the value of bitcoin the global network, rather than each bitcoin in isolation. The value of an individual telephone is derived from the network it is connected to. If there was no phone network, a telephone would be useless. Similarly the value of an individual bitcoin derives from the global network of bitcoin-enabled merchants, exchanges, wallets, etc... Just like a phone is necessary to transmit vocal information through the network, a bitcoin is necessary to transmit economic information through the network. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Myths#Bitcoin_has_no_intrinsic_value_.28unlike_some_other_things.29 it does not work today bitcoin has never been hacked, you can send and recieve transactions instantly world-wide (and they settle in 10 min not T+2). there are problem on how hard it is to use and that only a few take it as means of payment. progress is being made, but it's not done yet. and it is ok that it not every little detail is solved yet. this was the case both with cars and electricity. [^antonoop-infrastructure-inversion] [^antonoop-infrastructure-inversion]: andreas antonop has a good chapter about infrastructure inversion in his non tech book. at first they say \"it is so slow, it cant work, look\" because the car tries to work in the current infrastructure of kullersten and horses hit. when you build roads for cars, both the horse and the car can go on that road, however, the car flourishes. that is an example of infrastructure inversion. another example is using electricity in your home. in the beginning it was only right people and nuts who had it. your house could be burnt down, etc. because the infrastructure was gas pipes... same principle as in the car-horse-example. The case for crypto in an institutional portfolio todovip: write a bullish section. Portolio thinking When considering whether or not to invest in an asset, an investor should study the asset not in isolation but rather as a part of the entire portfolio. It does not make sense to exclude Twitter from SP500 simply because the stock is too risky for one's risk preference. Rather, one should compare the SP500 with Twitter included vs the SP500 with Twitter excluded. After comparing the two portfolios sector allocation, risk-return profiles, etc then the investor can make a decision of whether to exclude Twitter or not from his portoflio. Low correlations ![Digital assets and traditional financial assets exhibit low - sometimes negative - correlations. Hence digital assets can be used to diversify a traditional portfolio.](path to file containg 1 or 2 correlation matrix plots.) The primary conclusion to draw from this matrix is that the correlation between virtual currencies and traditional assets are far below one, hence they can be used to diversify a traditional portfolio. It seems like the crypto asset class exhibit different return patterns than traditional financial assets such as gold and stocks. The secondary conclusion to draw from this matrix is that the correlation between different virtual currencies are below one, reflecting the fact that these these currencies are different from each other. This correlation between assets in BlockchainX is a reason to hold our certificate, since a strategy of buying merely Bitcoin and Ethereum would miss out on the other 8 assets which are diversifiers thanks to their low (and sometimes negative) correlations. Moreover, only buying two assets rather than a basket is sub-optimal due to performance reversals. Performance reversals For a long period Bitcoin outperformed almost all other virtual currencies in the top 10 index. During the price drop of Bitcoin in January 2018, three of the top 10 digital assets - EOS, NEO and Stellar - realized positive returns. Only twice in 12 months has the top-performing coin repeated the feat of being the best performer in the following month.[^ref-12months] These performance reversals clearly demonstrate the benefits of diversification. It also provides a good reason to buy a slice of the market, instead of trying to pick a few virtual currencies and hope they will perform. [^ref-12months]: todo: which 12 months? was it the most recent 12 months? or during 2017? Expansion of the efficient frontier Let us be crystal clear in our analysis of adding virtual currencies to a traditional portfolio, by re-visiting the traditional \"efficient frontier plot\". The reason why a correlation matrix matter to an investor is that the correlation structure allows him to enjoy higher risk-adjusted returns. When the correlation between the assets are lowered, the portfolio's volatility is lowered too. So what happens when we add cryptocurrencies (market in the figure as crosses) to the universe of investable assets? Cryptohtmlcurrencies are marked in the figure as crosses. Thanks the statistical properties of these assets - namely their returns, volatility and correlation structure - the efficient frontier expands to the left. This expanded efficient frontier is drawn as a dashed gray line in the figure. Thus investors who include cryptocurrencies in their portfolio can enjoy better risk-adjusted returns, which is a logical result since adding choices always leaves an investor better off. ![Adding digital assets expands the efficient frontier.](traditional markovitz efficient frontier plot e.g. Efficient-Portfolio-Frontier with two asset classes. and a figure with corr matrix to the left maybe?)

Traditional portfolio w and w/o 3 to 7 percent BLX allocation Due to its superior returns, BLX ends up being qq % of the entire portfolio. This is not what we advice. We suggest a small portoflio weight to BLX. Below we have the same comparison as above, but after rebalancing so that BLX are kept around 5% of the entire portfolio (recall: portfolio thinking above). More formally, we have a target weight of 5% with 0.40 tolerance rate so that whenever the weight of BLX goes above 7% it is rebalanced down to 5% and whenever the weight of BLX goes below 3% it is rebalanced up to 5%. For simplicity we assume zero trading cost for selling (or buying) BLX and buying (or selling) the traditional portfolio. The effect this tolerance based allocation strategy has is shown in the figure. ![When we use tolarance rebalancing, the wieght of BLX is kept close to the target rate of 5%.](path to file. it is similar to bitwise area plot, however, we put them side by side to make the comparison easier. the purpose is to pedagogically show what the difference is between using tolerance rebalncing and not. the graph allow us to spend much less time explaining.) ![](time series plot w two lines: portofli ow BLX and w/o BLX with tolarence rebalancing.) the number of rebalancings were todo insert number. description of setup - vet ej var denna section ska in TRD: A traditional portfolio with 60% weight in stocks and 40% weights in bonds.

BAL: A balanced portfolio of 95% TRD and 5% BLX. Rebalanced whenever weight in BLX go above 7% or below 3%. good text from the report This report explores the case for including a small but meaningful allocation to cryptoassets in a diversified portfolio. Specifically, it examines the impact that a 1%, 5%, and 10% allocation to Bitcoin would have had on a traditional 60% equity/40% bond portfolio since Jan. 1, 2014. The potential impact was large: With a 5% allocation, for instance, the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio nearly doubled, total returns more than doubled, and the maximum drawdown was substantially reduced. The study looked at the period Jan. 1, 2014 through March 31, 2018. This period was chosen because it captures two of the worst bear markets in Bitcoin history: The 85% pullback from January 2014 through January 2015, and the 64% decline from December 2017 through the conclusion of the study in March 2018. The study considered looking at returns since Bitcoin\u2019s inception on publicly available exchanges in 2010, but the early returns of Bitcoin were so high that they skew the analysis. In 2013, for example, Bitcoin\u2019s price rose 5,507% (see table). The chosen start date captures what amounts to the worst historical scenario for adding Bitcoin to a portfolio. Despite this (intentionally) adverse timing, the study found that a systematic allocation to Bitcoin significantly increased the portfolio\u2019s risk-adjusted returns, assuming a diligent rebalancing strategy was in place. In fact, a small allocation to Bitcoin achieved this result without increasing the risk profile of the portfolio in any meaningful way. The results were remarkable: The \u201cQuarterly Rebalanced Portfolio\u201d captured similar returns as the HODL Portfolio (58.51% vs. 67.70%), but did so with less than half the risk (9.0% vs. 19.8%). Quarterly rebalancing also massively reduced the maximum drawdown, which fell from -32.68% to just -9.25%. This drawdown was actually lower than the maximum drawdown experienced by the Traditional Portfolio (which didn\u2019t hold Bitcoin at all). In an effort to better constrain Bitcoin\u2019s weight in the portfolio, the study looked at a Tolerance-Based rebalancing strategy using a 50% tolerance. That meant rebalancing the 5% Bitcoin allocation any time it hit 7.5% or 2.5%. Virtual currencies are an emerging asset class In our view, digital assets represent a new emerging asset class, which by construction is not comparable to any asset class previously in existence. We argue that digital assets are a good example of a decoupling phenomenon, just as in case of emerging markets. Thus, they are good diversifiers of risk exposure to traditional asset classes.","title":"Part2"},{"location":"2part2/#internet-of-money","text":"Bitcoin is fast cheap global mobile payment.

Before money societies relied on gifts and barter, both of which severly limits trade. Gifts limits a transaction's value and whom we can trade with, since knowing the person or having a history of successful gift exchanges would be required for valuable trades to take place. ((Another drawback with gifts are that they rely on humans remembering the quality and amount of the good which was recieved, and this is a common source of conflicts.)) Barter limits the liquidity and frequence of trade, because if paying in-kind is the only option then both the buyer and the seller must be willing to buy and sell each other goods simoultaneuously. This requires a coincidence of wants, which is unlikely. For example, what should the fisherman do when he has caught more than he is able to eat? Perhaps the fisherman need clothe, but if his society relies on barter then he must find a tailor today - otherwise the fish will be worthless. The tailor might not be hungry, but in this case the fisherman might be able to trade the fish for nuts, the nuts for beer, and the beer for clothes. Obviously the coincidence of wants introduces liquidity and accounting problems: will there be a path from fish to clothes via trading, and what are the appropriate exchange ratios for all goods? In an economy with 100 goods there are 4950 prices to keep track of. Moreover, barter is impossible for the musician who needs to pay rent to his house landlord. Money solves these problems. All goods can be priced in terms of only one other good so that there are not thousands of exchange rates to keep track of (money is a unit of account). And the musician can recieve money when he plays the piano at a bar (money is a medium of exchange). He can use these money later to pay his rent (money is a store of value). Money can be defined in terms of its functions as a a medium of exchange, store of value and unit of account. Anything that fulfills these properties can be used as money. Throughout history we have used many forms of money: seashells, knifes, cows, alcohol, and large stones formed in the shape of doughnuts. All of these fall under the category of commodity money. All commodity money is easy to understand, and most of them function reasonably well as a unit of account. Some commodities are more money than others, thanks to their proporties such as look, weight, divisibility, and scarcity. Gold and solver coins was introduced in 600 BC, and later on many societies used coins that had been issued by the king. Paper money was used in China during the 11th century due to the physical hurdles with commodity money. Gold and silver merchants gave out reciepts which could redeemed for a certain amount of the commodity. This form of money fall under the category of representative money. The reciepts were in essence IOUs because it was the person who held the reciept who had the right to redeem it. Paper money came to Europe during the 13th century, and by the 18th century gold coins had been replaced by paper money backed by gold. This monetary system is referred to as the gold standard. The paper notes were backed by gold in the sense that they were convertible into a certain amount of gold. In the 20th century almost all countries used the gold standard and made these notes legal tender. todo skriv sista stycket mha denna text fr\u00e5n wiki och videon https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNo7MDN5-0g \"After World War II and the Bretton Woods Conference, most countries adopted fiat currencies that were fixed to the U.S. dollar.

Secure - Encrypted cryptographically and can\u2019t be brute forced or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets. Programmable - Individual units of bitcoin can be programmed to transfer based on certain criteria being met Nearly instant - From a few seconds to a few minutes depending on need for confirmations. After a few confirmations transactions are irreversible. Peer-to-peer - No intermediaries with a cut, no need for trusted third parties. Portable - Bitcoins are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold. They can even be transported by simply remembering a string of words for wallet recovery. Scalable - Each bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimals allowing it to grow in value while still accommodating micro-transactions. Designed Money - Bitcoin was created to fit all the fundamental properties of money better than gold or fiat","title":"from reddit"},{"location":"2part2/#from-bitcoin-wiki","text":"Unlike gold, bitcoins are: Easy to transfer Easy to secure Easy to verify Easy to granulate Unlike fiat currencies, bitcoins are: Predictable and limited in supply Not controlled by a central authority (such as The United States Federal Reserve) Not debt-based Unlike electronic fiat currency systems, bitcoins are: Potentially anonymous Freeze-proof Faster to transfer Cheaper to transfer","title":"from bitcoin wiki"},{"location":"2part2/#different-blockchains","text":"Bitcoin is not the only blockchain project, although it was the first.

To understand why there is an equillibrium in which several blockchain projects with the same vision and use cases co-exist, consider that blockchains have a set of parameters. examples of such parameters are level of decentralization, tx cost, confirmation time, througput, inflation rate, permissions etc. It is impossible to optimize for all parameters. Trade offs must be made. When functionality is increased, security might usffer. When the level of decentralization is decreased, it might be possible to increase throughput.

Another example is that bitcoin has a lower feature set (payments) vs ethereum (smart contracts and a world computer) but enjoys higher security since it bitcoin has not been hacked whilst Etherum has - arguably due to the complexity of the scripting language and functionality Etherum tries to achieve.))

Specifically, it examines the impact that a 1%, 5%, and 10% allocation to Bitcoin would have had on a traditional 60% equity/40% bond portfolio since Jan. 1, 2014. The potential impact was large: With a 5% allocation, for instance, the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio nearly doubled, total returns more than doubled, and the maximum drawdown was substantially reduced. The study looked at the period Jan. 1, 2014 through March 31, 2018. This period was chosen because it captures two of the worst bear markets in Bitcoin history: The 85% pullback from January 2014 through January 2015, and the 64% decline from December 2017 through the conclusion of the study in March 2018. The study considered looking at returns since Bitcoin\u2019s inception on publicly available exchanges in 2010, but the early returns of Bitcoin were so high that they skew the analysis. In 2013, for example, Bitcoin\u2019s price rose 5,507% (see table). The chosen start date captures what amounts to the worst historical scenario for adding Bitcoin to a portfolio. Despite this (intentionally) adverse timing, the study found that a systematic allocation to Bitcoin significantly increased the portfolio\u2019s risk-adjusted returns, assuming a diligent rebalancing strategy was in place. In fact, a small allocation to Bitcoin achieved this result without increasing the risk profile of the portfolio in any meaningful way. The results were remarkable: The \u201cQuarterly Rebalanced Portfolio\u201d captured similar returns as the HODL Portfolio (58.51% vs. 67.70%), but did so with less than half the risk (9.0% vs. 19.8%). Quarterly rebalancing also massively reduced the maximum drawdown, which fell from -32.68% to just -9.25%. This drawdown was actually lower than the maximum drawdown experienced by the Traditional Portfolio (which didn\u2019t hold Bitcoin at all). In an effort to better constrain Bitcoin\u2019s weight in the portfolio, the study looked at a Tolerance-Based rebalancing strategy using a 50% tolerance.
