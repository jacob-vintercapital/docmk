((Introduction)) ((We believe we're in the early stages of something truly transformative, we believe that several things needs to be built for this to happen and we are set out to build of the infrastructure needed to be part of the disrupting force.)) This Whitepaper is structured as follows. In Part I we explain why indexing and passive investing has grown popular the last decade. In addition, we derive explain where diversification comes from and why it improves a portfolios risk-adjusted returns. In Part II we discuss why cryptocurrencies are valuable and how they can be used. In Part III we bring up some problems with investing in cryptocurrencies and describe how our product solves these problems. We also provide what additional benefits our product brings to individual investors and the market as a whole. Part I. Why indexing Indexing makes sense for financial markets in general and for cryptocurrencies in particular. Indexing and traditional finance A passive investor does not try to beat the market, instead, he invests in vehicles like index funds and ETFs tracking the SP500. An active investor , by contrast, tries to outsmart the market by making active bets such as trying to pich the right stock. These bets make it possible for an active investor to perform better or worse than the market. The last 20 years a strong trend has emerged within the financial markets - passive investing is on the rise. In 2017 the net inflow from active funds to passive index funds were USD 500 billion. ![Money flows from active funds to passive index funds.](/figures/net-flows-1.png) There are good reasons for investors to put their money into passive vehicles. Academic empirical studies have shown that trying to beat the market is an unprofitable strategy. For an overview of the literature see for example [Fama's 1952 article][fama-1952] in the Journal of Finance. To understand why passive investing beats active, consider the following sequential logical argumentation, written in the form of three statements: Active managers cannot collectively beat the market. Sub-groups of active investors do not beat their index. Top performers do not stay top performers. [fama-1952]: todo insert link to paper effient cpaital markets. The first statement is just plain arithmetic, and was proved by Sharpe in 1991 . Some active managers must have returns higher the market, and some must have returns lower than the market. As a collective, they will have a return equal to the market. After including fees, however, the sum of all active investors will be beaten by the market due to trading costs. Secondly, active managers investing in a certain style (e.g. stocks with low high dividend yield or small cap growth stocks) do not beat their sub-index. This make sense because almost any style can be replicated with an index, and since indexes are less costly than portfolio managers an investor can get the same return for a lower fee. The last line of defence for active investing is that whilst the two previous statements are true, there exists people who can make the right judgement call and beat the market consistently. Data suggests the opposite. Every year, some investors do indeed beat the market, but these investors are different persons from year to year. By ranking the portfolio managers in one period, and then studying how they performed in the following periods, it is evident that the top performers do not stay top performers. This is logical, since risk taking can give extreme returns - sometimes extremely positive and sometimes extremely negative. The performance of active money managers provides the best evidence yet that indexing may be the best strategy for many investors. /Damodaran, Professor of Finance at NYU. Diversification Portfolio theory has had a huge impact on finance. Markovitz, who won the 1990 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, invented portfolio theory in 1952 with his famous paper titled Portfolio Selection published in the Journal of Finance. Portfolio theory changed the lens through which assets are considered. Before Markovitz, investors held a small number of stocks and tended to evaluate their stocks in isolation. Today, almost all investors evaluates their portfolio as a whole before buying or selling assets. ![Investors can recieve better risk-adjusted returns by diversifying their holdings.](todo insert path to simple markovitz graph with only one type of assets. SP500 can be the ORP.) To understand why portfolios are attractive investments, we can utilize an \"efficient frontier plot\". Any textbook on portfolio theory contain a version of this graph. In the plot we see a collection of assets with their historical volatility on the x-axis and a their expected return on the y-axis. Holding one of these assets will give the investor a certain risk (volatility) for a certain reward (return). Investors want high returns and low volatility, so the upper left corner is an ideal place to be. When comparing assets agsinst each other there is, of course, a trade-off between risk and reward: taking on more risk (by for example selling some T-bills and investing in a startup) does increase the expected return but also leads to higher volatility. The efficient frontier is the set of (return, volatility)-points the investor can get if they buy a portfolio of assets, and it is illustrated with a solid black line in the figure. Every single point on the efficient frontier is a portfolio the investor can have. The efficient frontier is located close to the ideal upper left corner, reflecting the fact that portfolios are more attractive than owning a single asset. The reason for this is diversification. ![](corr plot of sp500 and 10 or 20 assets.) Correlation is the driver of diversification. When the assets are correlated less than 1.00 with each other, it is possible to increase the risk-adjusted returns by diversifying. The lower the correlations between the assets, the more this solid line will expand to the upper left corner. Here is an important but subtle point: Even though an asset like gold might have inferior risk adjusted returns to some stocks, it can be rational for an investor to include gold in his portfolio because doing so improves the portfolio as a whole. Diversification stems from correlation, and if gold has a low correlation with stocks then including it will lead to better risk-adjusted returns of the entire portfolio. Indexing and cryptocurrencies Portfolio theory has not influenced the cryptocurrency market yet. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies, and many hundreds are traded on large exchanges. But out of the few people that have bought cryptocurrencies, owning only 1-3 different cryptocurrencies is the norm. Just like different companies operate in distinct sectors, different cryptocurrencies try to solve different problems - some focus on building a general purpose scripting language and others on integrating their software with the current banking system. Just like stocks, cryptocurrencies have a lower correlation that makes them suitable to be included in a portfolio. As seen in the figure, the correlation between cryptocurrencies is around 0.20 which is lower than the correlation between stocks. Therefore indexing makes even more sense with cryptocurrencies than it does for the stock market. ![Cryptocurrencies exchibit low correlation with each other, hence indexing them into a portfolio is attractive.](path to corr matrix with crypto top 10 - excluding our BLX.)","title":"Part 1"},{"location":"part1/#our-product","text":"We have created a diversified index that tracks the prices of cryptocurrencies, in a similar way that the SP500 tracks the prices of equities.
